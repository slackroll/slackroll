changelog

This operation displays the most recent set of change log entries that have
been downloaded from the mirror. Usually, this operation is run after the
"update" operation when there are available upgrades.

The following paragraphs explain how slackroll manages the change log entries.
This infomation is usually not important for an end user, but is provided here
for documentation purposes. Feel free not to read it.

In detail, the "update" operation downloads change log entries by sets, one at
a time, stopping when it finds an entry it has already downloaded. It stores
those sets in a database ordered by date, assigning them a set number.  Each
entry is also assigned a number inside each set. These two numbers, in the
format "setnumber.entrynumber" form the change log database that can be listed
using the "list-changelog" operation and selectively displayed using the
"changelog-entries" operation. Also, the database can be rebuilt from scratch
by fully downloading the available change log at any point in time, using the
"download-changelog" operation.

An example from the output of "list-changelog":

    18.0      Tue May 18 06:48:06 UTC 2010
    17.0      Tue May 18 02:41:17 UTC 2010
    17.1      Mon May 17 23:19:08 UTC 2010
    16.0      Mon May 17 07:54:23 UTC 2010
    16.1      Mon May 17 04:28:49 UTC 2010
    15.0      Sun May 16 06:00:06 UTC 2010

The "changelog" operation merely takes all the entries from the latest set and
displays them on screen. Usually, these entries correspond to the pending
upgrades.
