erase-tmp

This operation expects no arguments. It will erase any file found in
/var/slackroll/tmp. Normally, you never need to run this operation, but
occasional files may be left in /var/slackroll/tmp if downloads are interrupted
and never resumed, for example. Running it should pose no risk whatsoever.

Also see: erase-cache, erase-all.
