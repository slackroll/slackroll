download PKG...

This operation expects the same type of arguments as the "install" operation,
that is, a list of package names or specific package versions. However, instead
of installing or upgrading packages, this operation will only download the
package archives, its signatures and verify the signatures. It will not proceed
with the installation steps, as the install operation would.

Also see: install.
