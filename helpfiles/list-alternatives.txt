list-alternatives

This operation expects no arguments. It will print a list of every package for
which more than one version is currently known, and a detailed list of every
available version, either locally installed or available in remote trees. It is
sometimes useful to see, for example, which packages have alternative versions
in the /testing tree, or in /pasture.

Also see: list-versions.
