local-info PKG...

This operation expects a list of package names or specific package versions,
like the "info" operation. It is mostly equivalent to the latter. The
difference is that it can only be applied to packages present in your system,
and the amount of information it prints. "local-info" prints the full contents
of the files in /var/log/packages, instead of omitting the package contents
like "info" does.

It was added because it is usually faster to type "slackroll local-info PKG"
than to run "less /var/log/packages/PKG-something", but other than that they
are mostly equivalent.

Also see: info.
