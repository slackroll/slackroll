install PKG...

This operation expects one or more package names as its arguments, and is
slackroll's equivalent to the "upgradepkg --install-new" command, with the
usual extras. This means that "install" can be used to both install packages
that are currently not installed in your system, as well as upgrade outdated
packages or change the installed version of a package, provided several
versions are available.

The usual extras are automatic package downloading from the mirror, signature
verification and reviewing .new files after installation.

Its arguments can be package names or specific package versions. If you only
provide the package name and several versions are available, slackroll will ask
you which version you want to install. In this case, if you already have a
version installed in your system, the program will print the installed version
above the option prompt, should it give you a clue about which version you may
be interested in.

Examples:

slackroll install sqlite
slackroll install amarok-2.3.0-i486-1.txz
slackroll install ./slackware/kde/amarok-2.3.0-i486-1.txz

The last two commands are equivalent.
