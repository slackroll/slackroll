broken-symlinks DIRECTORY...

This operation expects a list of directories from your file system. It will
print any broken symlink which is found under that directory. This operation
may take some time to complete, depending on which directory you specify.
Broken symlinks, in general, can be removed without being too problematic.
However, it should be noted that some packages provide symlinks to files found
in other packages. If those other packages are not installed, the symlink will
be broken. Still, it could be a good idea to keep the symlink there in case you
decide to install those other packages.

It's a system maintenance operation that probably will only be needed once in a
blue moon.
