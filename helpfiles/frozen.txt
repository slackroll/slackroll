frozen PKG...

This operation expects a list of package names as its arguments. It can be used
on "installed" packages to mark them as "frozen", hence preventing them from
being moved to the "oudated" state by slackroll, as described in the tutorial.
Also, as the tutorial mentions, there are a few packages that are required to
be in the "frozen" state by definition. For example, "aaa-elflibs", if present.

Also see: freeze, unfreeze, installed.
