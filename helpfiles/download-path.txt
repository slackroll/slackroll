download-path REGEXP...

This operation expects a list of Python regular expressions as its arguments.
It will attempt to download every remote package with a package path matching
any of the provided regular expressions. For more information on remote paths,
see the help for the "install-path" operation. This operation is equivalent to
it, but it will not proceed with the package installation once the packages
have been downloaded.
