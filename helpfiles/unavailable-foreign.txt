unavailable-foreign

This operation expects no arguments. It is equivalent to the "foreign"
operation provided you were to call it with the names of the packages in the
"unavailable" state as its arguments. It's an operation frequently run during
the program setup and can sometimes be useful if you decide not to use the
"install-foreign" operation.

Also see: foreign, install-foreign.
