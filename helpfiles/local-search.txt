local-search REGEXP...

This operation expects a list of Python regular expressions, and can be used to
answer the question "which package does this file belong to?". It will search
for those regular expressions in the list of files for each package, and
provide a summary of the results. It is essentially equivalent to running
multiple "grep" commands on /var/log/packages/*, except that it will skip
header lines in those files, hence not providing false positives.
