download-key-packages

This operation expects no arguments. Strictly speaking, it should be called
"download-outdated-key-packages", but the name was shortened for obvious
reasons. It is equivalent to the "download" operation applied to the list of
outdated key system packages (aaa_glibc-solibs, glibc-solibs, sed and
pkgtools).

Also see: download, upgrade-key-packages.
