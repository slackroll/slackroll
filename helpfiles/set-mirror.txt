set-mirror URL

This operation sets the preferred mirror URL. The change log, FILELIST.TXT and
package files will be downloaded from this mirror, and this operation is one of
the first ones that need to be run for the program to work properly. The URL
you enter should typically be an HTTP or FTP URL, pointing to the directory of
the specific Slackware version you are running.

Examples:

slackroll set-mirror 'http://slackware.osuosl.org/slackware-current/'
slackroll set-mirror 'http://slackware.osuosl.org/slackware64-13.0/'
