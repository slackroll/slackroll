info PKG...

This operation expects a list of package names or specific package versions,
and will print information about the selected packages. This information is
obtained from one of two sources. If the package is not installed, it is
obtained from the .txt files present in the remote trees, if they exist. If the
package is installed, it is obtained from the package file present in
/var/log/packages.
