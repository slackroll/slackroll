list-upgrades

This operation expects no arguments. It will print a detailed list of packages
in the "outdated" state. The list includes the currently installed version of
every outdated packages, as well as every known remote version of them.

Normally, this operation is not needed, as "list-transient" provides the list
of every package in a transient state, including "outdated" packages, and
information about locally installed versions and available remote versions is
not considered interesting. However, this operation has not been removed in
favour of "list-transient" because of the additional information it provides
about upgrades, which is not provided easily by other operations.

Also see: list-versions, list-new, list-transient, list-unavailable.
