add-repo URL...

This operation adds one or more URLs to the list of third-party repository
URLs. A third-party repository is a non-official URL were Slackware packages
can be found. For third-party repositories to work properly with slackroll,
they need to have a file named FILELIST.TXT at the path indicated by the URL,
with the exact same internal format as official mirrors.

All packages in third-party repositories need to be signed with an additional
.asc file like official packages, and the key used to sign these packages needs
to be present in the superuser's keyring so they can be verified. Please note
the import-key operation will not download and import keys from third-party
repositories, as a security measure. They need to be imported by hand. You can
download the key file and use "gpg --import".

In addition, they could have MANIFEST.bz2 files in standard format just like an
official mirror. If present, this makes it possible to search for specific files
in packages from those repositories using the manifest-related operations.

Also, if repositories provide a .txt file for each package, like an official
mirror, it's possible to use info-related operations with their packages too.
