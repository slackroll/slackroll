unavailable PKG...

This operation expects a list of package names as its arguments. It will mark
them as "unavailable". Note that you normally don't need to run this operation
at all, as slackroll will mark packages as "unavailable" in the appropriate
cases automatically. It could be used, however, to correct small user mistakes.
Only "foreign" packages can be marked as "unavailable".

Also see: new, for an example of the type of user mistakes in question.
