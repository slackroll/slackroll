install-path REGEXP...

This operation expects a list of regular expressions as its arguments. It will
install any remote package whose path matches any of the given regular
expressions.

Every remote package has a path, as can be seen the output of some slackroll
operations, like "list-versions". See an example as of the time this help text
is being written:


# slackroll list-versions gcc-gfortran
Available versions:
    gcc-gfortran:
        Local:  gcc-gfortran-4.4.4-i486-1
        Remote: ./slackware/d/gcc-gfortran-4.4.4-i486-1.txz

End of list


The "./slackware/d/" part that appears in the remote version is the remote
path, and that's what install-path checks. For example, if we wanted to install
every package from the "d" set, including gcc-gfortran, we could use:

slackroll install-path /slackware/d/

The regular expression "/slackware/d/" is found in the path of every package
from the "d" set.

Note that these regular expressions follow Python's notation. They are, for
most common cases, compatible and similar to egrep and Perl regular
expressions, but in case of doubt and for very specific details that are
normally not needed, the documentation for Python's regular expression notation
can be found at:

http://docs.python.org/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax
