touch

This operation expects no arguments. Normally, you don't need to ever run this
operation. Still, in a few moments in the past of slackroll, while several
important changes were taking place, you needed to run this operation after
updating to a new program version, so it was kept for this reason.

Its purpose is to simply force an update in the package database that contains
the package states, as done after an update operation.
