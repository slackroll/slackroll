foreign PKG...

This operation expects a list of package names as its arguments. It marks them
as "foreign", and can only be used in "unavailable" packages. When installing
foreign packages, the "install-foreign" operation can be used to both install
the package and mark it as foreign at the same time. However, should you decide
to install packages without "install-foreign" or forget to do so, they will be
detected as "unavailable" by slackroll, because there's no reliable method to
tell unofficial from official packages. This operation can be used to mark them
as foreign, the same way it is done during the initial program setup.
