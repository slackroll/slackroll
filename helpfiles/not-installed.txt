not-installed PKG...

This operation expects a list of package names as its arguments. It will
attempt to mark the indicated packages as "not-installed". Not every package
can be put in the "not-installed" state. The most frequent use of this
operation is to mark as "not-installed" any "new" packages we are not
interested in installing.

Example:

slackroll not-installed koffice-l10n-ca@valencia

Also see: install, install-new.
