missing-search

This operation expects no arguments. It will take some time to complete and is
one of those maintenance operations that are only run on very rare occasions.
It will study the list of files that should be present in your system,
according to the contents of /var/log/packages, and attempt to detect if any of
them is missing. There will be a few false positives in the results. For
example, bash usually gets installed as /bin/bash4(.new), but is later moved to
/bin/bash. /bin/bash4 will be detected as missing but it's not a problem at
all.

It could be useful if you accidentally delete files by mistake, and want to
know which packages have been affected, in order to reinstall them.
