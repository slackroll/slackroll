upgrade

This operation expects no arguments. Upgrade will do a lot things for you, but
the general purpose is to upgrade outdated packages. It will not install new
packages and it will not remove unavailable packages. Only outdated packages
are taken into account.

Its main actions are downloading, verifying package signatures and upgrading,
using upgradepkg, the packages that are outdated. It will do extra things
sometimes, like letting you review .new files or letting you choose a specific
package version if several ones are available, but its usage is mostly
intuitive.

When it prompts you to choose a specific package version, it will also print
the version currently installed just above the choice question, as this may
give you clues about which one you may want to install.

For a description on how reviewing .new files works, read the help on the
"dotnew" topic.
