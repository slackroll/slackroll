batch OPERATION [ARGUMENT...]

This operation expects another operation and its arguments and runs it without
user interaction. slackroll will error out if user input would be needed to
select a specific package version among several. In addition, all other
interactive operations are done automatically with a predefined behavior.

* On package removal, every .new file pair left behind will be removed.

* On package installation, if a single file exists in a .new file pair, it will
  be kept without the .new suffix. If both files exist, both files will be kept
  for manual review later.

* No interactive confirmation prompts will be present.

* No pagination will be used.

Examples:

slackroll batch install sqlite
slackroll batch kernel-upgrade
slackroll batch remove bash-completion
