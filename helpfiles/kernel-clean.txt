kernel-clean

This operation expects no arguments. It removes from your system the outdated
versions of installed kernel packages, while keeping the ones that are
up-to-date. It's usually run after booting to a new kernel you have installed
with kernel-upgrade and verifying there are no problems with it.

Also see: kernel-upgrade.
