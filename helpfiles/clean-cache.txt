clean-cache

This operation expects no arguments. When downloading package archives,
slackroll stores them in /var/slackroll/packages/. This is called the package
cache. As time passes and packages are upgraded, old package archives may
accumulate in that directory taking up precious hard drive space.

Not automatically removing old package archives from the package cache can be
useful. Specially if you run slackware-current, the old package archives in
there may save your life because they allow you to manually go back to a
previous version should an upgrade bring a nonworking package of some kind.

However, from time to time and as upgrades are proved to be reliable, you
probably want to run this operation and get rid of any old and no longer
relevant package archive stored in the package cache. Note that this operation
will not completely empty the package cache at all.
