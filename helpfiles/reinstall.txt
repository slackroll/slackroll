reinstall PKG...

This operation expects a list of package names as its arguments. Think of this
operation as slackroll's equivalent of "upgradepkg --reinstall", but with the
typical extras slackroll provides, like automatically downloading the package
if needed, or the process of reviewing .new files.

Also see: install, dotnew.
