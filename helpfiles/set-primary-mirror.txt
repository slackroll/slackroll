set-primary-mirror URL

This operations sets the primary mirror URL. You probably do not want to change
the primary mirror URL, but this operation is provided for completeness and for
giving the program more flexibility.

The primary mirror is a trusted mirror from which the GPG-KEY file, if
requested, will be downloaded. More importantly, package signatures are also
downloaded from the primary mirror, while the full package files are downloaded
from the mirror you chose with set-mirror.

The default primary mirror is http://slackware.osuosl.org/ followed by a
subdirectory according to the Slackware variant and version obtained from your
mirror of choice. This mirror is the main Slackware mirror, is almost
guaranteed to be up-to-date at any given moment, and is almost never down.
