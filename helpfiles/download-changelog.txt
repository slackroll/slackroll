download-changelog

This operation expects no arguments. It will download the whole ChangeLog.txt
file from the remote mirror and will rebuild the change log database with it.
Useful to reset the changelog database from time to time if you do not wish to
keep the whole change log history, specially when running -current.

Also see: changelog.
