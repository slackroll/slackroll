import-key

This operation is completely optional. It downloads the GPG-KEY file from the
primary mirror and adds it to your GPG keyring. If you already have the
Slackware key in your keyring, running this command is not needed at all. It is
provided just for convenience. Having the Slackware key in the GPG keyring is a
must, since the key is used to verify the package signature of every package
you download.
