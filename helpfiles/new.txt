new PKG...

This operation expects a list of package names as its arguments. It lets you
put packages in the "new" state. Normally you don't need to do this at all, as
slackroll will put packages in that state by itself when it's appropriate.
However, it can be used to correct small user mistakes. It can only be used
with packages in the "not-installed" state.

For example, suppose there is a group of new packages and you do not want to
install all of them. You mark as "not-installed" the ones you're not interested
in, intending to run "slackroll install-new" after that. However, you make a
small mistake and mark as not-installed a package you wanted to install. You
can correct this small mistake either running the "install" operation on that
package explicitly or by marking it as "new", to get it back to the "new"
state, prior to running "install-new".

Also see: not-installed.
