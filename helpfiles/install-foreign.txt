install-foreign FILE...

This operation expects a list of one or more package archives present in the
file system. As you may know, the "foreign" package state is reserved to
packages you install yourself and which don't have an official package in the
remote tree. Instead of installing those package using "installpkg" or
"upgradepkg" and then marking them as "foreign" with the "foreign" operation,
you can directly use this operation to perform both tasks at the same time.
It's the recommended method to install "foreign" packages.

Also, it features some extras like the automated process of reviewing .new
files after installation.
