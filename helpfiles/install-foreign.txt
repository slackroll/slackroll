install-foreign FILE...

This operation expects a list of one or more package archives present in the
file system. As you may know, the "foreign" package state is reserved to
packages you install yourself and which don't have any known remote source.
Instead of installing those package using "installpkg" or "upgradepkg" and then
marking them as "foreign" with the "foreign" operation, you can directly use
this operation to perform both tasks at the same time. It's the recommended
method to install "foreign" packages.

Also, it features some extras like the automated process of reviewing .new
files after installation.
