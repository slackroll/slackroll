remote-paths

This operation expects no arguments. It will print a plain-text list of all the
package files in any remote tree, with their relative paths.

As mentioned in the FAQ, this operation was created ad-hoc, and should be
useful to artificially populate the slackroll package cache with symbolic links
to a local mirror of the Slackware tree, which some people have and like to
keep up-to-date with rsync.

Also see: path-search.
