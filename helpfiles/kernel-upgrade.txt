kernel-upgrade

This operation expects no arguments. It upgrades outdated kernel packages in
your system, with the main difference that it installs the new package using
installpkg instead of upgradepkg, which lets you preserve the old kernel while
you boot to the new one. After you've booted with the new kernel, you can
remove obsolete kernel packages with the "kernel-clean" operation.
