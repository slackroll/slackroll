installed PKG...

This operation expects a list of package names as its arguments. It marks those
packages as "installed". You can only do this with "frozen" packages. Since
this is the operation that you need to run to unfreeze a package, but it's
usually not found by intuition, the "unfreeze" operation was created as an
alias for this one.

Also see: freeze, frozen, unfreeze.
