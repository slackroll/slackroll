urls-upgrades

This operation expects no arguments. It's mostly similar to both the "upgrade"
operation and the "download-upgrades" operation. This one, in particular, will
stop the process before reaching the download step, and will print the URLs
that would be used. It could be useful to feed the URLs to a more advanced
downloader, or to save the list to a file if you wish to download the package
archives and signatures from a different computer.

Tip: urls-upgrades, as "install", "upgrade" and every other related operation,
will ask questions when an outdated package has more than one remote version
available, in order to let you choose which version you want to install.
However, if you want to save the list of URLs to a text file, these questions
can be a minor problem, as they will be hidden if you redirect the command
output using the common redirect operator, >. As mentioned in the FAQ, you can
pipe the command output to "tee file.txt" instead to do basically the same.
Later, you will need to edit the text file and remove the extra lines at the
beginning.
