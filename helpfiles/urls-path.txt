urls-path REGEXP...

This operation expects a list of Python regular expressions as its arguments.
It will print the URLs of the package archives and signatures of every remote
package with a matching remote path. For an explanation on this, see
"install-path". This operation is related to both "install-path" and
"download-path", with the difference that nothing is installed or downloaded,
and the URLs are printed.

Also see: install-path, download-path.
